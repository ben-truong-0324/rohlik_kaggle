# Kaggle Housing ML Project

This project leverages machine learning models to predict housing prices based on the Kaggle House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques dataset. We explore a variety of techniques, including decision trees, bagging, and boosting, to predict home prices in Ames, Iowa, using the provided explanatory variables. This project covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and result visualization.

## Project Overview

Data is retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data
In this competition, participants are tasked with predicting the final sale price of homes in Ames, Iowa, based on 79 explanatory variables. These variables cover almost every aspect of residential homes, from architectural features to neighborhood characteristics. The goal is to develop models that can predict home prices accurately using regression techniques.

## Installation and Setup

### **Setting up the Conda Environment**

To set up the project, it is recommended to use the provided `environment.yml` file to create a conda environment with the necessary dependencies.

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate ml_general

# download/copy data into raw.txt in ./data/raw.txt
python -m kaggle_housing/etl.py
python -m kaggle_housing/dt.py
```
